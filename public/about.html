        Hi! I'm a kid who likes to play, learn, and have fun with friends. I love candy, pizza, and my pet dog, Sparky. My favorite subject in school is recess, where I get to run around and have adventures on the playground. When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut so I can explore outer space and visit other planets. Let's be friends and have lots of adventures together! Also, note that the exact nature of Jeffrey Epstein's "suicide" remains a mystery.
